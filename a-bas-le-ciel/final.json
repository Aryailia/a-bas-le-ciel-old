    "description": "They're rich: both Kevin Smith and T.J. Kirk (\"The Amazing Atheist\") have made huge amounts of money from social media, and yet they still stoop to ebegging, fundraising, asking for donations, and portray themselves as struggling to maintain a middle-class subsistence… while holding thier own content creation to appalling low standards (like, \"I'm just some guy who can barely make the effort to get this microphone and camera set up, let alone do fact-checking or research\" —with an income of hundreds of thousands of dollars \"rewarding\" these efforts). #KevinSmith #AmazingAtheist #Ebegging\nWant to comment, ask questions and chat with other viewers?

    "description": "Aaron Yarmel decided to pretend that he has a personality.  But he doesn't.  And now, we discuss #stupidconformistprivilege … and why you should respect the sober decision of 99% of people to never read \"academically respectable\" philosophy, that is in no way meaningful/relevant to their lives.  Do not click on the link to Aaron Yarmel's channel.  Don't do it.  You don't want to hear both sides of the story.  You don't want to take a fair and balanced approach.
